Ready to enter a virtual music concert? Concertland will provide you with an engaging and satisfactory experience comparable to a physical concert.

> P.S. 
> - One thing which we missed most is being able to attend physical concerts and festivals
> - During covid, it was difficult to attend live concerts and festivals. With concertland, you can get the experience (virtually of course).


## Games:
Concertland is a game consisting of many games that virtualises what would be experienced in a physical concert but in the comforts of one’s home. Concertland invites you to experience our key events:
- Ticketing
    - Choose the colour that corresponds to the ticket category
- Dance Double
    - Engage in a dance battle with your friend! Play side-by-side in this memory game, as you try to beat one another.
- Dance Box
    - Dancing and just vibing is an essential at concerts:)Take a break from games and head on to the disco-floor! Interact and choose the music you want to dance to!
- Cheering 
    - Cheering for your favourite performers feels better when you follow the crowd!
    - In this game inspired by Tap Tap Revenge (and other rhythm games with a similar concept), press the keys on beat so that you will cheer with the crowd (otherwise, you’ll scream alone awkwardly..).
